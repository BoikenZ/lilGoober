### Lil Goober!

Used youtube tutorials to figure out how the display works.

Used this ssd1306_minimal library i found on some website (cant remember)for the display,
as i have the lil goober running on an adafruit trinket 3v3, and it only has 8kb flash, the
normal library is too large to run on it.
