### Lil Goober!

Used youtube tutorials to figure out how the display works.

#### 
Used this ssd1306_minimal library I found on some website (cant remember) for the display,
as i have the lil goober running on an adafruit trinket 3v3, which only has 8kb flash, so the
normal ssd1306 display library is too large for it. 

I have plans on modifying it to connect to vehicle's OBDII port to read computer data, and change
faces based on speed, acceleration, braking, and other values.
